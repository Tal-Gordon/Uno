# Uno
School final year project 

This is a game developed in Unity, currently version 2022.2.9f1. It's made to work on LAN between 4 players or less. The project requirements include communication (as in, over a network) which is why this game is not bots only. Otherwise my life would have been much easier. And who wants that, of course.

Why am I writing this anyway? No one will ever read this.
